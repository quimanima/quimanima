[**ABSTRACT**]{lang="en-US"}

[Is it possible to apply knowledge of High School Chemistry to Object
Oriented Programming (OOP)? In the technical high school in the
integrated modality, these disciplines are generally taught separately,
when they could be related, which would facilitate the understanding of
both. To solve this problem the developing a package in the Python
programming language to make animations that address chemical phenomena
has started. In the development of this module, knowledge from other
disciplines has applied too, such as: Mathematics, with the use of
Cartesian coordinates, polar coordinates, rotation matrix and sparse
matrix; Physics, with concepts such as the Laws of reflection; And
English, for module development and in reading the programming language
